# AeroVerse-Twin: 737 Research Aircraft ✈️

## Project Overview
This project is a high-performance RC scale model of a Boeing 737, built from scratch using foamboard. As a 12th-grade CS student, I am using this project to bridge the gap between web development and aerospace engineering.

## Key Features
- **Dual Brushless Power:** Synchronized 2212 1400KV motors.
- **Scale Controls:** 8+ channel setup for flaps, landing gear, and dual-engine logic.
- **ESP32 Telemetry:** Custom "hack" to log battery and flight data for the AeroVerse web platform.

## Planned Parts List (BOM)
